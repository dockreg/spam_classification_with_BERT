        "This notebook details part two of the CA4023 assignment 2. This requires the use of the transformer language model BERT which was developed by Google in 2018 (Devlin et al. 2018). This notebook undertakes the third option in this assignment which is fine tuning BERT on another dataset. The selected task is spam classification. This spam classification is on the sms messages dataset. The dataset is available from HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sms_spam)"

The presence of slang and abbreviated text language did not cause any issues for the robust BERT model and shows the ability to apply the model across a variety of tasks. There were 4 False positive and 4 false negatives out of the 1,100 samples in the test set indicating an equal performance of the model across both type 1 and type 2 errors."
